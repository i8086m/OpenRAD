Put simply, the steeper the line from your bottom bracket to your grips, the more range of motion you’ll have for braking, cornering and going down things, and the better your bike will feel on technical descents. The shallower that line, the more your bike will feel optimized for climbs.

Recommended RAAD for Trail Hardtail = 58-60° (56-58° Sagged)



Less angle pros:

As the bars get farther away from the rider (within reason), the rider gains more potential sprint and climbing power. The rider can pull the bars farther before they hit the hips. Some pro BMXers say moving the bars away gives them more “pull.” This is what they’re feeling.

Traditional road and cross country riders will find the longer cockpit familiar. (But the bars will feel low unless you raise the bars, which will give you a traditional XC fit with an excessive bike RAD — and that’s not what we’re doing here). 

Less angle cons:

The rider gives up range of motion on steep downhills, jump landings and in corners. If staying off your face is important to you, do not reduce your rider area angle. 

The traditionally long cockpit usually comes with bars that are too high, which makes a too-long rider area and decreases power out of the saddle. The”wisdom” that long stems improve climbing is bullshit, especially when standing.

My trail bikes are all about 58°. This gives me a good balance for up and down.
